This program checks the properties of a graph including:

getRoots() - finds a set of verticies that are considered to be the roots of a graph
isReflexive() - determines if the graph is reflexive
isSymmetric() - determines if the graph is symmetric
isAntiSymmetric - determines if the graph is anti-symmetric
isTransitive() - determines if the graph is transitive
isEquivalence() - determines if the graph is an equivalence relation
getEquivalenceClass(vertex) - finds a set of verticies in the equivalence class of the given vertex

iterativeBreadthFirstSearch() - Performs iterative breadth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a breadth first search traversal order
iterativeDepthFirstSearch() - Performs iterative depth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a depth first search traversal order
or
recursiveBreadthFirstSearch() - Performs recursive breadth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a breadth first search traversal order
recursiveDepthFirstSearch() - Performs recursive depth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a depth first search traversal order
