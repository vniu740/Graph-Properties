This program checks the properties of a graph including:

getRoots() - finds a set of verticies that are considered to be the roots of a graph<br>
isReflexive() - determines if the graph is reflexive<br>
isSymmetric() - determines if the graph is symmetric<br>
isAntiSymmetric - determines if the graph is anti-symmetric<br>
isTransitive() - determines if the graph is transitive<br>
isEquivalence() - determines if the graph is an equivalence relation<br>
getEquivalenceClass(vertex) - finds a set of verticies in the equivalence class of the given vertex<br>

iterativeBreadthFirstSearch() - Performs iterative breadth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a breadth first search traversal order<br>
iterativeDepthFirstSearch() - Performs iterative depth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a depth first search traversal order

or

recursiveBreadthFirstSearch() - Performs recursive breadth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a breadth first search traversal order<br>

recursiveDepthFirstSearch() - Performs recursive depth first search on the graph and returns a list of verticies in a depth first search traversal order
